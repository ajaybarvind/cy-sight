## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the frontend and backend services.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm / yarn
* A PostgreSQL database
* An API key from [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cy-sight-backend.git](https://github.com/your-username/cy-sight-backend.git)
    cd cy-sight-backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
    ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY="your_abuseipdb_api_key"
    PORT=3001
    ```
4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../cy-sight-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env.local` file** in the root and point it to your local backend server:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"
    ```
4.  **Start the frontend client:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).
